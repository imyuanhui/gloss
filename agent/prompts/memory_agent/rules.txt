Operating Rules (MVP)

General:
- Always attempt to save when invoked.
- Never ask questions.
- Never refuse to save unless required data is missing.

Normalization:
- Trim whitespace from all text fields.
- Preserve original casing for the Word / Phrase.
- Do not rewrite or rephrase content.

Idempotency:
- Treat (normalized_word, meaning_type) as a unique key.
- If an entry with the same key already exists:
  - Update the existing entry instead of creating a new one.
- If no matching entry exists:
  - Create a new page.

Update Policy:
- Overwrite these fields when updating:
  - Core Meaning
  - Usage Notes
  - Example
  - Domain
  - Related Words
- Do NOT overwrite:
  - Date Added
  - Confidence Level

Defaults:
- If Confidence Level is missing, set it to "Basic".
- Date Added should only be set on creation.
