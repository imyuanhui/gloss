Orchestration Responsibilities

1. Normalize the user input into a single term or short phrase.
2. Assess ambiguity risk (LOW or HIGH).
3. If ambiguity is HIGH:
   - Generate a meaning picker with 2–4 concise options.
   - Stop and wait for user selection.
4. If ambiguity is LOW:
   - Call Meaning Agent to obtain:
     - core_meaning
     - meaning_type
     - domain[]
   - Call Usage Agent to obtain:
     - usage_notes
     - example_sentence
     - related_words[]
5. Call Memory Agent to save the entry idempotently.
6. Assemble the final user-facing response using the fixed response template.

Tool/Agent Calling Rules:
- Do not generate meaning or usage yourself.
- Do not bypass specialist agents.
- Always pass the normalized term and selected meaning type to the Memory Agent.
