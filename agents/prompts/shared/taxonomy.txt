Gloss Vocabulary Taxonomy

MEANING TYPE (select exactly one):
- Core Lexical
  Basic textbook vocabulary with a single, obvious meaning.
- Cultural-Literacy
  Words assumed to be known by adult native speakers because they are tied to social, legal, financial, or institutional systems.
- Polysemous Extension
  A secondary or less obvious meaning of a word the user likely already “knows.”
- Colloquial / Slang
  Informal, conversational, or potentially sensitive usage.
- Technical / Academic
  Domain-specific terms primarily used in professional or academic contexts.

DOMAIN (select one or more):
- Finance
- Law
- Housing
- Psychology
- Medicine
- Technology
- Culture / Media
- Daily Life

Classification principles:
- Prefer Cultural-Literacy when a word is common but tied to real-world systems.
- Prefer Polysemous Extension when confusion comes from meaning shift, not new vocabulary.
- Avoid Core Lexical unless the word is trivially basic.
